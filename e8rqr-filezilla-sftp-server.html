                            <p>I am currently using approx or seedbox.co I have been pretty happy with how things have been but I want to see if there are better alternatives to seedbox.co I am not looking to spend any more than 20USD a month. I don't use seedboxes for Plex because I have my own HDD where I keep my files local. I really need something with 2TB+ of storage and fast FTP speeds. Right now with seedbox.co it ranges from 1mbps to 300kbps. and with certian file sizes I don't want to wait all day to transfer. I’m getting Error: Package: . Requires: . So I figure I’m missing libraries needed to get the package. When I try to get the library it tells me The system is not registered with an entitlement server. I tried to change enabled=1 to enabled=0 in the subscription-manager.conf file but that didn’t allow me to get the libraries either. I’m kind of new to Linux so little lost. Let me know if I can answer more questions. Side note: what’s  Alrighty so I've been tasked with setting up an ftp server that'll hold all of our company data so the app that is being developed for iPads can access it. amp#x200B; So, what steps can I take to make FTP safe? amp#x200B; it'll be filezilla since it has to connect to an existing windows share. 
I'm looking to set up an SFTP server to connect with my Amazon AWS EC2 instance (Win 2012 Server) but when I tried to set up the Filezilla Server (downloaded from Sourceforge) it tried to change my default search engine, browser settings, etc., etc. I use Dropbox and Google Drive but I find FTP to be much faster and easier. Looking for suggestions that are easy, and free-to-inexpensive. At my place of work I've set up a SFTP server for clients to upload files in a secure fashion. For the more tech-savvy of them, installing a client and using such software is not a problem. However, for the smaller, less tech-savvy, maybe without a IT-admin to help them, we are looking for a secure file upload portal of some kind, either in the cloud, or installed on a server locally. Anyone have any suggestions and experience with some good alternatives? edit: Grammar. Hi, coming from windows there is winscp. It is a gpl v3 SCP client. I tried using filezilla, but I couldn't manage to make it connect via SCP. So, do you know a working scp client like winscp for linux? EDIT: Looks like it's not a filezilla issue. When I install filezilla on my windows machine I can connect. So I guess the server admin has blocked linux hosts. Morning all, I am in the middle of setting up a 2FA SFTP server for the company I work for. The stack I am going for is as follows: Bare metal install Ubuntu 16.04.4 OS OpenLDAP phpLDAPadmin KVM with Kimchi VM Ubuntu 16.04.4 OS Ldap client vsftpd duo 2fa using pam This is my first major go at getting this type of job done with Linux so learning as I go. Previous had a fairly successful Plex setup at home running on esxi using linux as OS but that was years ago. So far everything. Hi all, currently trying to set up an SFTP site on my server that is also running an ftps site from iis 7. I am trying to setup filezilla server for the SFTP site but having an issue connecting. Created a rule on the firewall to allow SFTP traffic on port 22 and mapped a directory on the C drive to connect to with the test user but when i try to connect externally i keep getting a 500 syntax error on the server and unable to connect on the client side. Anyone seen issues like this before 
Hey guys, scratching my head over this because I feel like I'm just missing something simple. I have my FTP port forwarded correctly because I can access my smb shares outside my network with filezilla but it's horribly slow and I don't prefer the interface. I'm trying to access an FTP connection using finder on my mac. When I try to connect it says: "There was a problem connecting to the server XXX.XXX.XX.XX - The file server will not allow any additional users to log on. Try to connect again. I am configuring a Server 2016 based server to sit in our DMZ and provide one task, SFTP access. What program is recommended to provide SFTP? I know Filezilla server works, and it looks like Windows built-in FTP server supports this as well. Should I be looking at one of these, or a different option altogether? We are only going to have around 25 accounts. The server will only have one way in and that is on the SFTP port. It will be virtualized, so it can be managed from the vsphere client. I am looking for a free FTP/SFTP program for Windows server 2016. I have a handful of odd programs that require it internally and can't seem to find a good one. I was using FreeFTPd but when I upgraded the server OS to 2016, it causes the CPU to spike like crazy and lock up the server. What do y'all. I'm not sure if it's just FileZilla, it's toolkit or KDE. It was working fine for a while but at some point the window stopped repainting updates, to monitor a transfers progress or navigate a directory I have to resize the window to force a re-paint(so maybe it's a Kwin issue?). I've experienced this many months ago with Firefox in the past, so it might not have anything to do with the client and just be a weird compositor bug. That aside is there anything similar? How does Dolphin's I have a server that I can SSH to using PuTTY. I can even have multiple instances of PuTTY open, and it works fine. However, sometimes when I connect to the server through FileZilla (using SFTP) to transfer files, it disconnects all of my PuTTY sessions! It gives the error: "Network error: Software caused connection abort". I've gone through almost every thread on this sub regarding the issue of SSH on the latest jailbreak(s). The first thing I tried was running the following in mterminal: launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist This worked initially, but since stopped. I ran it again considering it worked the first time, but to no avail the second. So I went searching, and learned of Wi-Fi SSH for Dropbear. Installed that tweak and still. 
Just taking advice here. We have a need to transfer large database backups from A to B. File size is 0.5 to 6GB. Has to be secure, for our (and our clients) peace of mind and occasionally there's some very secret financial data being transferred (PampL type stuff). We've tried FTP before and it works fine for about 80% of clients. But our clients are often technically deficient so FTP will occasionally be met with "what's that?" Plus I suspect that some of our clients are seeing FTP traffic. Any suggestions? Yes, I know there is OpenSSH for Linux (and a MS port), but Linux isn't an option, and "free" is really important. Any suggestions? The other option is FTPS using IIS, but I would rather do SFTP if at all possible. Arq looks easy enough to set up with Amazon and other services, but I would also like to create backups across my network to my a loaded win 10 box. Do I still need to set up an SFTP server even if I am moving data locally? If yes, Could you guys recommend a simple (lower cost) tool for setting up an SFTP server? (use simple words Hi guys, I'm trying to setup a Filezilla ftp server on my home PC with a Bell router. I enabled passive mode custom port range on the server since I had the warning that I might be behing a NAT router. I can't seem to correctly forward or understand the PASSV ports forwarding. External can connect but it disconnect right away and I get an error that the ports might not be opened. Log: Reply: 227 Entering Passive Mode ( , , , , , ) Command: MLSD Error: Could not establish data connection:. Restart the relevant services like Microsoft FTP Server if you've changed the port numbers! It's common sense we'd all say but the reality is when you're tired, frustrated, have other things on your mind and/or are pissed off at BES . common sense troubleshooting goes out the window. Doing this one thing solved half the problems my peers amp I were having in regard to setting IIS FTP SSL. So that's one thing down, and more testing/work I would like to transfer files from my windows pc to my Pi3 running Ubuntu mate over my local network. I know there is a way to do it over ssh called ftp or something, but what would be the best way to go about it? Edit: Answer in comments. 
Hey Gang, Which one do you prefer, IIS or Filezilla? One of our departments asked if they could have a general purpose, public facing FTP server for some upcoming projects. I really dont want to spend hours on this so I have opted to go with windows and I figured I could just slap IIS or Filezilla on it. Which one do you prefer? Or should I just go ahead and build it in CentOS. Proftpd or PureFTPD is not hard to setup but it does take more time than a windows box. And samba Is there any way to transfer files over a home WiFi network between Windows and Linux? I have searched google a bit, but can't seem to make sense I realize what I'm asking here, but I was wondering if anyone knows of a free FTP Server that exists out there, in the vein of Filezilla? I know that Filezilla used to be open source, free, and offer a server (which is what I need), but after so many bad reviews and warnings, I don't trust it or Source Forge anymore. Has something stepped up to replace it? Just curious.
