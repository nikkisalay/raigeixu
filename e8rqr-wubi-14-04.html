                            <p> I want to install Ubuntu onto my laptop I use for school, however the manufacturer has locked the BIOS and I may get in trouble if I bust open the machine and reset the CMOS. How can I use Wubi with 14.04? Thanks in advance. For some reason, even after booting in safe mode, the problem persists. Each time, I see the Kubuntu wallpaper and the mouse, but no further installation screen. The screen isn't black so I'm not sure if it could benefit from nomodeset flag, and I don't have any USB or CD/DVD to burn to a copy. Also another reason I am using WUBI is that the person I am installing it for doesn't want me to "mess up her computer" so, I figured the easiest way to help her was to install it inside of Windows inste. Hello I have a quick question about ubuntu 14.04 is it possible to install it "inside" windows like what i was previously able to do for linux mint using mint4win? i know about wubi but cant seem to find one for 14.04 thanks. #Update is live now, if you're not seeing the update you can update through Upgrade Assistant tool https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 #~~Update isn't live yet, you can join our community chat to get notified whenever it starts rolling out~~ https://discord.gg/Microsoft ##What's Creators Update?

American Megatrends BIOS. This is what I tried so far: Preparation: Disable secure boot (bios) and fast boot (in windows). Enable legacy support (bios). Partition drive (in windows). 1) unetbootin with linux mint 18.1 - outcome: after HP splash screen, system stopped at some sort of windows bootloader with options for either windows 10 or unetbootin. the unetbootin option led to a system boot error screen about one of the files that unetbootin changes. 2) Burn linux iso to dvd (ubuntu. 
One of my friends has got this low-end Acer laptop with 32GB of eMMC (update: model is es1-111m-c414) and wanted to install Xubuntu 16.04 LTS on it in order to get a snappier experience and have more room for activities compared to Windows 8.1. We managed to get a dual-boot working using WubiUEFI (a fork of the now defunct Wubi), which was required because the laptop's USB ports are toast and it has no CD/DVD drive. My friend wants to wipe Windows from the machine as it takes up a lot of space. Hello! I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell Inspiron 3531. The specs are below: Intel Celeron 2830 4GB RAM Intel Intergrated Graphics Windows 7 64 bit (downgraded from Windows 8) I've been wanting to make the switch for some time now. I have used Ubuntu in the past with my old computer, now I'm looking to get it for this one. I want to replace the OS of my computer to Ubuntu ONLY. Questions: 1.) Will the performance be any better? I have tried Wubi for the time being, but it feels. Ok, so I've been wanting to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 for a while. When I got my laptop with Windows 7, I made a bootable USB and booted into Ubuntu. However, when I wanted to install it, it didn't give me the option to install alongside W7. Leaving that alone, I now have three options: A) Partition C: to leave empty space on the hard drive so I can install Ubuntu (Kinda nervous about this because I may screw something up) B) Use a virtual machine to emulate Ubuntu on W7. It only gives me 32bit. Hi, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 8.1 on my 4 years old laptop a couple of days ago using the Wubi method. Today I got a prompt for an upgrade to 14.04, so I decided to go through with it. Now while booting up I get this error ( How do I solve. I'm running Windows 7, and I am looking to replace the OS with Ubuntu altogether. I downloaded the .rar file from Ubuntu.com ( and unpacked it into my 500GB external hard drive (I do not have a small thumb drive or an optical disk drive). It came with a .exe called "Wubi" that when I run, brings up a screen trying to install Ubuntu with two options: 1. Reboot now- My computer reboots I have been trying all this morning to install Linux on my computer. I originally was going to go with Arch or Linux Mint, but ran into issues when I was trying to boot from both USB and DVD. I made the USB drive with the Universal USB Installer tool, as instructed with the proper iso files. After these failures, I decided to try regular old Ubuntu via their Wubi loader. I then came to discover that recent updates the OS ended Wubi support, though the stripped down installer still functioned. 
So I have some familiar background and experience with ubuntu such as adding repositories, installing drivers, installing packages and software like spotify and skype, etc. But that was on my laptop. Yesterday I wanted to add ubuntu on my windows 7 pc just for the kicks of dual booting. Before I would use wubi to install ubuntu I made a 30gp partition in which I would use to install linux on. I ran wubi and installed a 7gb installation of ubuntu on my 30gb partition. After installing I am a new Linux user and I've been trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 using Wubi.exe. I've already downloaded the Iso and have copied both wubi and the Iso to an empty folder. The Wubi does not seem to detect the ISO. Here's a line from the debug report 05-02 11:37 DEBUG Distro: checking Ubuntu ISO C:\Wubi\ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso 05-02 11:37 DEBUG Distro: does not contain casper\vmlinuz.efi Please. Hi, I'd like to dual boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 on my laptop, however I encountered an issue. I made a bootable usb-stick with the latest stable release of Ubuntu and whenever I boot from the usb, I notice that the option to install Ubuntu “alongside Windows” doesn’t appear. Furthermore it shows that the entire drive as available, even though I have Windows installed on one partition (I’ve left 260GB unallocated). Not sure if this is important, but if I choose the option “try Ubuntu witho. Hi all, After failing to get 13.10 to play nice with Win8.1, I decided to install 12.04 so that wubi could do the work for me. Now I see 14.04 in update manager. Any advice on if it is ready to be a daily driver? The main perk I'm looking for is battery life, which I hear was dramatically improved by the current kernel. Thanks! EDIT: To clarify, the 14.04 preview is available right now. Having never used dev builds of Ubuntu, however, I don't know how stable they tend to be. For things I've been trying to duel install Ubuntu for days and it is officially driving me crazy. I've repartitioned my HDD to allow for 75 GB of space for Ubuntu. So far I've tried using Wubi with two different versions of Ubuntu (12.10 and 14.04). When trying 14.04 Wubi would not even start; I just got a message saying I am missing installation files (I don't see this as likely because I downloaded directly from the website). When installing 12.10 using Wubi it would load past this page, and restart. Always get similar errors on the finishing of install of various ubuntu versions: Error: J:\ubuntu\install\kubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
