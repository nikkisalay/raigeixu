                            <p>Hello everyone. I am quite new to LineageOS (Cyanogenmod). I am looking for some hint on what to do on failed system update. I have a current nightly build of LOS 14.1 for mako (LG Nexus 4). Shortly after phone reboot into TWRP (and typing a password to unlock encrypted partitions) I get a message, that "Zip file is corrupt!". I would be greatful for any useful hint on what should I do to make the update :-) Do the updates for nightly builds actually work all-right? My current LyneageOS. If you have ever thought of installing a custom ROM, custom kernel or rooting your Android phone with Magisk, then TWRP recovery is one of the major foundations. In this guide, we will show you how to install TWRP 3.3.0-0 on your Android device, which is the latest version available. Today I asked a question on here and mentioned I had root. This caused a few people to ask for a guide on how I got it. So, here it is: #Six initial things of immediate note before starting!: 1) This is for the exynos version (my specific phone is an international S9+ (G965f) running Pie and xposed, but it should also work with all Exynos S9/S9+'s) 2) As /u/Revanthmk23200 pointed out - getting root access on these phones trips a switch to say "this phone is no longer in warranty". This switch. Nexus 5 recovery flasher tool is a simple tool which can install the most familiar custom (CWM, TWRP, PhilZ) and stock recovery image for Google Nexus 5 phone easily using fastboot. So I "accidentally" wiped out my backup ROM (alongside the stock ROM ofc) in attempt to flash an incompatible custom ROM, now I'm left with no OS to boot to, I tried looking for the stock Firmware to flash back onto the device but so far no luck. amp#x200B; I would really appreciate any help atm, thank you amp#x200B; Custom recovery: TWRP 3.1.0.0 version: 0.5 version-bootloader: 3.19.0.0000 version-baseband: 0.57.62.0331 version-cpld: None version-microp: None version-main:. 
If you want to unlock bootloader, install custom recovery, root your android device or flash a custom ROM on your device, you’re bound to encounter the terms such as ADB, ADB Drivers and Fastboot. Hey everyone! amp#x200B; I'm newish to the custom rom life, but i ve been struggling with the latest build for 16.0. It seem no matter what i do i cannot get the google play store to run even after a flash right after doing a clean install. So not much better than when Android Pie would just randomly reset my Pixel when it felt like it. amp#x200B; i've followed the instructions on https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html (https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html) https://wiki.lineageos.o. About Project: This is my new project dedicated to all Nexus 5 users! It is based on unofficial Unlegacy Android Project 9.0 Beta.I’m not a great programmer, but I know how to achieve my goals. On my Nexus 6, lineage version 15.1, I attempted upgraded via the gui to lineage-15.1-20190205-nightly-shamu-signed.zip. However, I received the following message during reboot. gtThe password you entered is correct, but unfortunately your data is corrupt. gt gtTo resume using your phone, you need to perform a factory reset.  I have accessed to twrp and tried a few things to try to resolve. Installed and older ROM, lineage-15.1-20190130-nightly-shamu-signed.zip (https://linea. 
“Bootloop” is a very familiar term for smartphone users whatever OS they use, but it is definitely more familiar to Android phone users. Android being an Open Source operating system, is open to third party modifications. If you have a basic or advanced knowledge of Linux coding ve got a bit of an odd issue with my VS995 (Verizon v20). I'm attempting to root the device, but I can never manage to flash anything in TWRP. Everything gives me a "zip file is corrupt" error. I've tried using the alpha omega rom for the VS995 and a stock oreo rooted rom for the VS995. Both of them result in a "zip is corrupt" error in TWRP. Neither one of them have the "assert" line in the update script. Another oddity that may or may not be related to this is that I could not boot after.

Please note you will loose all personal data. I am not responsible if you device does not work, this will only work under certain conditions. Steps: 1. Boot into TWRP and enter your device password/pattern to decrypt data. 2. Download a stable Oxygen OS OTA file from Oneplus (https://www.oneplus.com/support/softwareupgrade). Connect your devic.

Hello, I am a novice when it comes to flashing ROMs and rooting but I managed to do it on my A2017U a few months back. I installed Lineage 15.1 with no issue. I am wanting to revert back to stock 7.1 (B35) and I have found myself stuck. I have installed the zip file on my pc but while that was downloading I took the time to boot into TWRP and wipe Lineage in preparation for flashing the stock ROM. During wiping, TWRP became unresponsive and now I can't boot into either TWRP as it won't. 
Edit: Solved So apparently I did not have the right version of TWRP installed! I was using an unofficial version since the current version at the time couldn't decrypt 8.0 partitions. Flashing the latest version of TWRP (see hiredantispammer's comment below) fixed the issue for me. As the title says. I have a OnePlus 5T with TWRP 3.2.1-0 recovery installed. I have managed to update the phone multiple times with no issues but now I am getting this whenever I try to install the last update:. Hi, Device: xiaomi mi5 aka gemini current OS: LOS 14.1 nightly from 23rd May 2017 TWRP : 3.2.0.0.gemini.img - Downloaded the latest zip from update SettingsgtLineageOS updates. Hit "Install", then it goes into recovery mode. Does nothing. - so I went to "Install", went in directory /data/data/org.lineageos.updater/app_updates selected the lineage-14.1-20171128-nightly-gemini-signed.zip file there. - If I uncheck Zip signature verification and Reboot after installation. I was fed up of being stuck in Android 6 on my Zenfone 2 (ZE551 ML). Since I had used Cyanogen a few years before on my old phone, I felt confident enough to try my hand at LineageOS. I tried to flash LineageOS right away through my phone's stock recovery and found out it was impossible (signature error), so I followed a couple guides on youtube to get my phone's boot unlocked and install TWRP. Took me a while but worked fine. I downloaded everything I seemingly needed (latest nightly build. So, I'm following this guide: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/serranoltexx/install#installing-lineageos-from-recovery (yes, I double checked my phone model and this is the correct guide). Installing heimdall and twrp suceeded, however I've encountered some problems when trying to install LOS. First: TWRP claims that my /sdcard/ directory is empty, even though it is not (I have uploaded the zip file with the given command and if I normally boot the phone I can see the file with a file manager. PROBLEM SOLVED Ok So i have installed custom roms in the past and also installed custom rom on my old m8 though i just got the m9 and some how, i fucked up so I have the TWRP recovery img installed on the phone, though for some strange reason when i mount the phone via USB to transfer the lineageos.zip to the phone to than install it wont let me copy the files says unexpected error. i believe something is corrupt So i copied the files to an sd card and inserted it. shows 8gb card but doesn. Hey guys Im not sure if this is the right place for this but i am in a big mess. I have a OP5 , it was rooted on stock 5.0 rooted with FrancoKernel. Everything was fine until i decided to go back to stock , wanted to get rid of the root and lock my bootloader. I downloaded the OOS 5.1 image from the OP website. I also read up on the procedures as per guides on how to revert to stock and unroot. What ive tried so far: I tried to flash the stock recovery and got in to it but i am unable Hello, am facing an issue  I tried to update my xiaomi mi5 to 10th of July nightly (currently running 4th), but keeps saying error 7 or zip file is corrupt  I tried downloading the update from the lineage website then moving to phone then manual flashing but same problem  Any ideas ? Am running twrp 3.1.0.1. I'm on a lineageos 14 nightly on serranoltexx from a couple of months ago (14.1-20170526-NIGHTLY-serranoltexx). I tried downloading an update couple of times during the last month, but when rebooting into TWRP I always need to pick the ZIP file manually and get a "Zip file is corrupt" error. I have seen other mentions of this error in relation with some gapps error, but I don't have the official google apps installed A couple weeks ago I did a factory reset and installed LOS 20170130 fresh. Since then, I've attempted to do automatic updates to the 20170206 and 20170213 nightlies. Both have failed. In both cases, I get ERROR 7 during the update, after the device reboots itself. The message it gives is: "Can't install this package on top of incompatible data. Please try another package or run a factory reset." I also try doing a manual install of the update zip from within TWRP, and it tells 
Hello everyone! Every time I try to flash the latest official release of LineageOS I get errors. In the newer TWRP versions i get an error saying that the zip file is corrupt, the old v2.8.0.0 TWRP says that it cannot open the zip file. I've tried redowloading the zip file multiple times, rezipped it, tried older versions, but it just simply won't work. I've flashed an unofficial (https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-l90/development/rom-cyanogenmod-14-lg-l90-t3474889) version onto my phone which. After some time I decided to update. This happened after encrypting my device, therefore I think this might be the reason. I have currently the nigthly 05/01 installed and my current TWRP-img is the most recent, i.e. 3.1.1-0. I tried two ways to flash lineage-14.1-20170515-nightly-bacon-signed.zip : 1) Via the OTA Updater, however TWRP says: Zip file is corrupt. Error installing zip file . 2) Via the LineageOS download section for bacon. Then in TWRP ERROR 7 occurs. I'm trying to install a custom ROM onto my Redmi Note 2 after seeing ROMs like Resurrection and LineageOS mainly due to poor USB connectivity of the MIUI8 and poor battery life performance (~3hours SOT). My custom recovery is TWRP 3.0 hermes. The issue initially was it not installing the packages due to error 7. I've come to realise my previous android version is 5.1.x and the rom was 7.1.2. (apparently Redmi Note 2 is still yet to support android 7.x). So i tried to install it at versions. My friend tried to root his Nexus 6P, and accidentally deleted the OS. I managed to flash a cyanogenmod .zip, but he wants the android OS, so I'm trying to flash a factory image of Angler from https://developers.google.com/android/images. He may or may not have promised me his old phone if I can fix this one. I'm using a mac. I have TWRP on the phone, adb and fastboot installed on the mac, and have used the latter to push the factory .zip file onto the phone. Everything is going In addition to the factory image, you'll need the following: Custom kernel. Benzocore ( is what I'm using at the moment. Custom recovery, i.e. TWRP (https://dl.twrp.me/shamu/) SuperSU (https://download.chainfire.eu/696/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip). This is a flashable version. Note that TWRP might offer to install this for you; don't let it, because the version it installs won't The last time I was able to successfully update my phone was on 28th of March. Since that date I am unable to install any updates. I redownloaded (I tried on a few wifis) and tried to install all of the weekly updates, but it failed with all of them. When I try to do it automatically from the update screen, then phone reboots, TWRP starts running and then I see the following: "Updater process ended with error 7 error installing zipfile '@cache/recovery/blockmap' When I am trying to insta. My internet is crappy and torrents are the best way for me to ensure that my file is downloaded properly and uninterrupted. Does OP2 offer torrents of their flashable zips? Also, delta updates don't work, where they download maybe 20 mb of data at most, doesn't work with my phone. I'd need the full 1 GB zip for it to work. My TWRP always interprets the zip file as corrupt Hey guys, So I'm stuck at work right now without a type-c cable and I had noticed that my device was asking me to update to this file: OnePlus3TOxygen_28_OTA_035-037_patch_1701041831_c9652aee6cc.zip After it downloaded it said reboot device now, to I clicked it and walked away for a bit. When I came back it was in the TWRP screen, So I went to install/downloads/OnePlus3TOxygen_28 and went to install it. It starts off normal by saying: "installing zip file" 'checking and skipping </p>
